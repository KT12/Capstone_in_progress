# capstone_in_progress

This is a repo to hold various parts of my [capstone project](https://github.com/KT12/Udacity/tree/master/capstone) which are experimental and may not be submitted in final draft.  The objective of the project is to attempt to find a relationship between news headlines and equity market moves.  The data is from a Kaggle dataset found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/aaron7sun/stocknews).

Since there are many files floating around, I wanted to be able to keep the submitted and work-in-progress part of project separate.

Tools used: Python 2, Jupyter Notebooks, scikit-learn, NumPy, Pandas, tensorflow, nltk
